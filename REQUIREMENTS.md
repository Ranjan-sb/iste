# ISTE Platform Requirements

## Overview

ISTE is a platform where users can create and manage their profiles. The platform supports multiple user roles, each with a distinct and potentially large set of fields. The system must be scalable, secure, and maintainable, following the best practices and project structure outlined in the existing documentation.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Registration & Authentication

- Users must be able to register and authenticate using email/password.
- Support for additional authentication providers (e.g., OAuth) is desirable.
- Authentication must be handled securely using the existing `better-auth` integration.

### 2. User Profiles

- Each user must have a profile containing personal and role-specific information.
- Profiles must support a large and extensible set of fields, including but not limited to:
    - Name, email, contact info
    - Role (e.g., student, faculty, admin, etc.)
    - Role-specific fields (e.g., department for faculty, year for students)
- Users must be able to view and edit their own profiles.
- Admins must be able to view and edit all profiles.

### 3. Roles & Permissions

- The platform must support multiple user roles (e.g., student, faculty, admin, alumni, etc.).
- Each role may have a unique set of required and optional fields.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) must be enforced throughout the application.
- Admins must be able to manage user roles and permissions.

### 4. Profile Field Management

- The system should allow for easy addition or modification of profile fields per role.
- Fields should support various data types (text, number, date, select, etc.).
- Validation rules must be enforced for required fields and data types.

### 5. Security

- All sensitive data must be securely stored and never exposed to the client.
- Proper session management and CSRF protection must be implemented.
- Input validation and sanitization must be enforced server-side.

### 6. Scalability & Performance

- The system must efficiently handle a large number of users and fields.
- Database schema should be optimized for querying and extensibility.
- Use code-splitting and server components for frontend performance.

### 7. Audit & Logging

- All profile changes must be auditable (who changed what and when).
- Admin actions must be logged for security and compliance.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- The platform must follow the file structure and best practices described in `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
- All code must be type-safe and use TypeScript throughout.
- Use tRPC for API development with Zod schemas for validation.
- Use Drizzle ORM for database management and migrations.
- UI should be modern, responsive, and accessible.
- Code quality must be enforced with ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks.

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness

- The entire application must be fully responsive and mobile-first.
- All pages, components, and dialogs must work seamlessly on mobile devices (320px and up).
- Navigation should adapt to mobile screens with hamburger menus and touch-friendly interfaces.
- Tables and data displays should have mobile-optimized layouts (cards, stacked layouts).
- Form layouts should stack vertically on mobile devices with full-width inputs.
- Buttons should be appropriately sized for touch interaction.
- Text should be readable without horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
- Tab navigation should be horizontally scrollable on smaller screens.

## Future Considerations

- Support for additional authentication providers (Google, GitHub, etc.).
- Integration with external systems (e.g., event management, notifications).
- Advanced search and filtering for user profiles.
- Bulk import/export of user data.

This requirements document is to be used as the basis for designing and implementing the ISTE platform. All features must align with the project rules and structure outlined in the main documentation.
