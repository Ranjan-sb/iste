# Cloudflare R2 Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration from local file storage to Cloudflare R2 object storage for the ISTE platform.

## What Changed

### 1. File Storage Backend

- **Before**: Files stored locally in `/uploads` directory
- **After**: Files stored in Cloudflare R2 object storage

### 2. Database Schema Updates

- **Removed**: `storedFilename` column (local file path)
- **Added**:
    - `r2Key` - Unique key in R2 storage
    - `r2Url` - R2 storage URL
    - `publicUrl` - Optional public URL for custom domains

### 3. New Dependencies

- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - S3-compatible client for R2
- `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` - For generating signed download URLs

### 4. Environment Variables

Added required R2 configuration:

- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
- `R2_PUBLIC_URL` (optional)

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

- `src/lib/file-storage.ts` - New file storage service for R2 operations
- `src/lib/env.ts` - Added R2 environment variable validation
- `src/server/db/schema.ts` - Updated files table schema
- `drizzle/0010_military_nova.sql` - Database migration

### API Endpoints

- `src/app/api/files/upload/route.ts` - Updated to use R2 upload
- `src/app/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts` - Updated to use R2 signed URLs

### Documentation

- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `FILE_UPLOAD_SYSTEM.md` - Updated system documentation
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Added R2 configuration
- `README.md` - Added environment variable examples

## Benefits of R2 Migration

### Scalability

- **Unlimited storage**: No local disk space limitations
- **Global performance**: Cloudflare's global network
- **Automatic scaling**: No infrastructure management needed

### Security

- **Signed URLs**: Time-limited access (1-hour expiry)
- **Access controls**: Granular permissions via API tokens
- **Secure storage**: Files not accessible without authorization

### Cost Effectiveness

- **No egress fees**: Unlike AWS S3
- **Generous free tier**: 10GB storage included
- **Predictable pricing**: $0.015/GB/month for additional storage

### Reliability

- **High durability**: Cloudflare's enterprise-grade infrastructure
- **Built-in redundancy**: Automatic replication across data centers
- **99.9% uptime SLA**: Enterprise-level availability

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Process

1. Client uploads file via `/api/files/upload`
2. Server validates file (size, type)
3. File uploaded to R2 with unique key
4. Metadata saved to database with R2 references
5. Client receives file metadata response

### File Download Process

1. Client requests file via `/api/files/[fileId]`
2. Server retrieves file metadata from database
3. Server generates signed URL from R2
4. Client redirected to signed URL for download
5. Signed URL expires after 1 hour

### File Organization in R2

Files are organized with the following key structure:

```
uploads/{userId}/{uuid}.{extension}
```

Example:

```
uploads/user123/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.pdf
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- All file operations require authentication
- Users can only access files they uploaded or from their applications
- Signed URLs prevent direct access to R2 bucket

### File Validation

- File size limits (10MB maximum)
- File type restrictions (PDF, DOC, DOCX only)
- Server-side validation prevents malicious uploads

### API Token Security

- R2 API tokens use least-privilege access
- Tokens should be rotated regularly
- Environment variables keep credentials secure

## Migration Impact

### For Existing Users

- **New uploads**: Automatically use R2 storage
- **Existing files**: Would need manual migration if any exist
- **No functionality changes**: Upload/download process remains the same

### For Developers

- **Environment setup**: Must configure R2 credentials
- **Local development**: Requires R2 bucket (can use same bucket with different keys)
- **Testing**: Upload/download functionality works identically

### For Deployment

- **Production setup**: Requires R2 bucket and credentials
- **Environment variables**: Must be configured in deployment platform
- **Database migration**: Automatically applied via Drizzle

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Usage Monitoring

- Monitor R2 usage in Cloudflare dashboard
- Set up billing alerts for usage thresholds
- Track file upload/download patterns

### Performance Monitoring

- Monitor upload/download success rates
- Track signed URL generation performance
- Monitor R2 API response times

### Maintenance Tasks

- Regular cleanup of unused files
- Monitor and rotate API tokens
- Review and update access permissions

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:

1. Revert database schema changes
2. Restore local upload functionality
3. Copy files from R2 to local storage
4. Update environment configuration
5. Redeploy application

Note: This should be planned carefully and tested thoroughly.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **CDN Integration**: Use Cloudflare CDN for faster delivery
2. **File Compression**: Automatic compression for large files
3. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate malware detection
4. **File Versioning**: Track file changes and versions
5. **Bulk Operations**: Batch upload/download capabilities

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategies
2. **Compression**: Automatic file compression
3. **Thumbnails**: Generate document previews
4. **Progressive Upload**: Support for large file uploads

This migration provides a solid foundation for scalable, secure file storage that can grow with the ISTE platform's needs.
